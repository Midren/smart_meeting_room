# PSoC 6 MCU emWin E-INK in freeRTOS

This example demonstrates displaying 2D graphics on an E-INK display using the EmWin graphics library.

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox™ IDE](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) v2.0
- Programming Language: C  
- Associated Parts: All [PSoC® 6 MCU](http://www.cypress.com/PSoC6) parts

## Supported Kits

- [PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062-BLE) (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) - Default target
- [PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062-WiFi-BT) (CY8CKIT-062-WiFi-BT)

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. Refer to the kit user guide to ensure the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the Code Example

### In ModusToolbox IDE:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File > New > ModusToolbox IDE Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **IDE Application** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox > Library Manager**. For more details, see the IDE User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_2.0/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Starter Application** window, choose the example.

4. Click **Next** and complete the application creation process.

See [Importing Code Example into ModusToolbox IDE - KBA225201](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-15968) for details.

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

3. Import required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board. 

   ### Using ModusToolbox IDE:

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.

   ### Using CLI:

   1. From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
        ```
        make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
        ```
        Example: 
   
        ```
        make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
        ```
        **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *libs* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the CE title is displayed on the UART terminal.

5. Observe the Startup screen with Cypress Logo on the display. Follow the instructions that comes on the screen after two seconds. Press the user switch to move between pages when the green LED is OFF.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the ModusToolbox IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. See [Debugging a PSoC 6 MCU ModusToolbox Project - KBA224621](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-15763) for details.

## Design and Implementation

### Resources and Settings

This project uses a CY8CKIT-028-EPD E-INK Display Shield together with CY8CKIT-062-BLE Pioneer Board. The E-INK Shield has a 2.7-inch E-INK display with a resolution of 264×176 pixels. 
For details on the Pioneer Board and E-INK Display Shield, see the Pioneer Kit Guide.

There are three important parts in this code example:
1. emWin Graphics Library: The emWin Graphics Library is implemented as a middleware in PDL and implements all graphics functions.  The library manages a display buffer and updates this display buffer with pixel data according to graphics operations performed.
2. E-INK Driver: The E-INK driver takes care of transferring the pixel data from the display buffer to the E-INK driver IC through a SPI Master interface and several GPIOs.
3. Application Code: The application code calls emWin graphics APIs to perform graphic functions, manages an application display buffer with cache (needed by the E-INK library), and calls the E-INK display library to update the display

[Table 1](#table-1-application-resources) lists the ModusToolbox resources used in this example, and how they are used in the design.
